Running on macOS Sequoia 15.1.1

Wifi don't work natively, so i use a TP LINK dongle (TL-WN725N) Driver that i use: https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-Big-Sur-Adapter

Bluetooth working.

I also use a SSD with TRIM enabled. My acer is stock except for the SSD and the RAM.

Headphone Jack do a cracking sound when connected, so i use a script on my Application folder that run on startup. (Jack fix)

My EFI folder contains opencore with picker enabled and verbose mode on.
